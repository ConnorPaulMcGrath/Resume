Some sample code from my work as a student.

The Image Query and Rel Feedback (Java) project is an implementation of an image query 
database that also allows the user to provide relevance feedback to the system to further 
improve the system's query results.

The Affine Image Transformations (C++) project implements image manipulations (including
scaling, shearing, rotating, and translating) with the use of matrix operations.
