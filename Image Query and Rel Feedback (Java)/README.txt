The Image Query and Rel Feedback (Java) project is an implementation 
of an image query database that also allows the user to select a query image 
and search for similar images using one of the methods available to the right 
of the query image. If "Toggle Relevance" is selected, then the user is able to 
mark image results as being relevant to help the system weigh relevant features 
for the next search iteration (RF iterations occur when the user presses the 
"Sort by Intensity + Color Code" button).
