The Affine Image Transformations (C++) project implements image manipulations 
(including scaling, shearing, rotating, and translating) with the use of matrix operations.

The ImageManipulator class requires a basic image handler class,
Image, which was given to us as a compiled binary. Because the 
binary belongs to my professor, it has not been included here.
